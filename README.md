## 🚨 The Problem Sangrakshak Solves

In today's rapidly digitizing world, websites, applications, and online services face an **unprecedented rise in automated malicious traffic—bots.** These bots are no longer simple scripts; they have evolved into sophisticated entities capable of:

- 🤖 **Mimicking human behavior** to bypass security systems  
- 🌐 **Launching large-scale DDoS attacks**, overwhelming servers  
- 🛑 **Scraping sensitive data** (emails, pricing, content)  
- 🔑 **Brute-forcing login credentials** for unauthorized access  
- 🔍 **Exploiting vulnerabilities** in web applications  
- 📈 **Inflating web traffic stats** to distort analytics & revenue models  

### 🔥 The Problem for Indian Startups & Developers  
Existing cybersecurity and bot mitigation solutions are:  
❌ **Prohibitively expensive** – Enterprise-grade tools are not affordable for small businesses  
❌ **Overly complex** – Requires deep security expertise to set up and maintain  
❌ **Restricted in India** – Many global security platforms lack UPI payment support or enforce geo-restrictions  
❌ **Dependent on foreign CDNs** – Leading content delivery networks (CDNs) charge high fees and impose data restrictions  

**India faces a unique infrastructural challenge:** 🚨  
- **Lack of dedicated, affordable, and reliable CDNs** → High latency, poor UX  
- **Absence of an Indian-compatible payment gateway** → Difficult monetization for early-stage startups

## 🛠️ Challenges We Faced (And How We Overcame Them)

### 🔧 1. Real-Time Bot Detection Without Labeled Data  
🚨 **Challenge:** No existing dataset had modern bot behaviors; traditional datasets were outdated.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- We created our **own synthetic dataset** using behavior simulation tools.  
- Designed **custom bot personas** and human-like interactions.  
- Used **Random Forest + Isolation Forest + Ensemble Voting** models for accurate classification.  

### 🌐 2. Developing Our Own CDN  
🚨 **Challenge:** India lacks fast, affordable CDNs; options like Cloudflare are costly & restrictive.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Built a **lightweight CDN using Nginx reverse proxy** & regional edge servers.  
- Implemented **custom caching layers** & fallback logic for high availability.  
- Result: Faster **content delivery, reduced load times**, and lower server costs.  

### 💳 3. Overcoming Payment Gateway Restrictions  
🚨 **Challenge:** Stripe, PayPal, and Razorpay **reject new startups**, making it hard for developers to accept payments.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Built a **DeepLink UPI Payment Gateway** using NPCI APIs & BHIM-compatible intents.  
- Allowed **secure, zero-commission, and instant payments**—even for MVP-stage users.  

### 🧠 4. Training ML Models With Limited Resources  
🚨 **Challenge:** No access to high-end GPUs, expensive cloud computing constraints.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Used **batch learning, data augmentation, and low-resource optimizations** in Google Colab.  
- Implemented **joblib-based model saving**, allowing us to resume training without data loss.
